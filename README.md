## What is Datapack Tools?
> What's Datapack Tool?
- Datapack Tool is a program being developed by me (WingedSeal) in python to help make datapackers' life easier. It can be useful for both beginner and advance datapack developer.
- It can setup a clean new datapack for you, It can make melee raycast much easier. etc.
- In fact, you can make a completely working datapack from the programs alone. ( Not like the said datapack will be useful though ).
- Keep in mind that it's just a tool and you should still have basic knowledge of datapack and commands to use it properly. 
- It is currently in an early development so you might expect a little bug here and there. I personally tested it multiple time and still found no major bug. But don't try pushing it to its limit by inputting stupid invalid data in there.
